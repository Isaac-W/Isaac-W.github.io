# [](#header-1)Plastic Oceans VR Experience

Created Fall 2017 for the VR for Social Good class.

## [](#header-2)Description

According to the Ocean Conservancy, an estimated 8 million tons of plastic ends up in the ocean every year. This is a large issue, considering that the plastic is not only polluting our oceans but also causing direct harm to marine life. The reality is that most of this plastic is coming from trash left on coasts and beaches. This trash eventually makes its way into the ocean ecosystem, where it can ensnare or be eaten by animals, creating a dangerous life-or-death situation for them.

My VR experience, Plastic Oceans, aims to educate people and raise awareness on this issue. Plastic Oceans will immerse you under the ocean to a world brimming with underwater life. In the experience, you will see firsthand how one simple act of littering on land can have dire consequences as you go underwater and see how the trash hurts marine life. The experience starts off by placing you, the player, on the beach. You have an empty cup in your hand. What happens next?
